	This document consists of steps and codes involved in creating Docker image and connecting different images through network.


# Have to import the python version used for your project from a Docker hub
FROM python: 3.6-slim-stretch

# Directory has to be created for the project in the Docker Container (named "project" here)
RUN mkdir -p /project

# Copying the all the project datas to the Created Directory inside docker Container
COPY projectFiles /project/projectFiles

# Listing the files in copied directory for verification purpose
RUN ls -la /project/*

# Required libraries has to be installed for the project by using requirements text(pip freeze > rquirements.txt) file collected from the virtual environment used for the project.
RUN pip install -r /project/projectFiles/requirements.txt

	# To Avoid requirements running again while creating the same image for modification:
WORKDIR /project/projectFiles
ADD ./requirements.txt /project/projectFiles/requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r /project/projectFiles/requirements.txt
ADD . /project/projectFiles ( ‘.’ --refers to current directory)

# Setting the Python path to make code executable
ENV PYTHONPATH "${PYTHONPATH}:/project/projectFiles"

# Install Necessary requirements files into container using "RUN" Command, as show in examples below 
    • RUN [ "python", "-c", "import nltk; nltk.download('stopwords')" ]
    • RUN python -m nltk.downloader punkt 
    • RUN python -m nltk.downloader wordnet

# Exposing the Port given in api files while running docker image
EXPOSE 5000

# Using the "CMD" to run the python script inside the container
CMD python /project/projectFiles/test.py

# Once docker file is created, use Docker commands to create Docker images and execute the created image(-t -- refers to tag)
docker build -t "image name" .  

#To check the images created, see our newly created docker image here)
docker images

#To check the docker images currently running
docker ps

# To check all the running images and history
docker ps –a

# To run Docker using Port
    • Giving only image name in iteration Mode
docker run -it -p 5000:5000 “image name”
    • Giving only image name in detach Mode
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 “image name”
    • Giving container and image name
docker run -it -p 5000:5000 --name=“container name” “image name”

# To save docker file
docker save 'Image name' > 'Image name'.tar
# Creating a network
docker network create -d bridge "network name"

#Adding a container to it you can add any number of containers
docker network connect "network name" "container name"

# To inspect the network for running containers inside network
docker network inspect “network name"

Additional Commands used which will be useful while using linux while creating docker image and connecting to network:

# To start Docker service in linux
systemctl start docker.service

# to Remove the docker images with none tags (While creating repeated images on same name none tag image will be added)
docker images | grep none | awk '{ print $3; }' | xargs docker rmi–f

# xgboost will cause(You are running 32-bit Python on a 64-bit OS)  error, so we have to add the below installation to avoid the same
RUN apt-get update && \
        apt-get -y --no-install-recommends install \
        libgomp1

# To remove Contanier (First stop and then remove)
docker stop “Conatiner name”
docker container rm "Container Name"
