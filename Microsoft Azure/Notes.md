### In-memory processing
It is an technology for processing of data stored in an in-memory database. Because stored data is accessed much more quickly when it is placed in random-access memory (RAM) or flash memory, in-memory processing allows data to be analysed in real time, enabling faster reporting and decision-making in business

### Distributed computing
Distributed systems are groups of networked computers which share a common goal for their work. In distributed computing, each processor has its own private memory (distributed memory). Information is exchanged by passing messages between the processors.
